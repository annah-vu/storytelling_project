This is where I will be putting my first storytelling project!
I hope I learn a lot from it! 

What I learned was it's important to tell the story, a lot of data and info will mean nothing
if you can't communicate it in a way that makes sense and is relevant to the problem.

Keep it short and to the point, the audience does not have a long attention span.

Tell them up front your recommendation.
